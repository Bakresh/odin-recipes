        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hawaiian pizza is an incredibly delicious type of a pizza! It consists of
            pineapple, ham, and cheese, and it gives an unique flavor that is to die for!
            In this recipe, however, we also include bacon. I'm sure you can agree that
            bacon goes very well with practically <strong>everything</strong>. So,
            without further ado, let's make one!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 homemade pizza crust</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (127g) pizza sauce (homemade or store-bought)</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups (6oz or 168g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (75g) cooked ham or Canadian bacon, sliced or chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (82g) pineapple chunks (canned or fresh)</li>
            <li>3 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare pizza dough through step 5, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C). Cover the shaped dough lightly with plastic wrap and allow it to rest as the oven preheats.</li>
            <li>To prevent the pizza toppings from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the shaped dough lightly with olive oil. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top the dough evenly with pizza sauce, then add the cheese, ham, pineapple, and bacon.</li>
            <li>Bake pizza for 12-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil, if desired. Slice hot pizza and serve immediately.</li>
            <li>Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months. See pizza crust recipe for instructions on freezing the pizza dough.</li>
        </ol>
