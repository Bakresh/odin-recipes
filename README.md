# odin-recipes
A project for The Odin Project

In my journey to become a web developer, I am studying in the amazing website, The Odin Project. In the middle of its Foundation course, I was instructed to start a "Recipes" project. Within the project, I will construct a webpage containing recipes. A very exciting moment for me!
